                    Hi, I'm Navaneeth Kamath, and I'd like to welcome you to my web bio page. I'm excited to introduce myself and provide some insights into my experiences and growth in the field of web development.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    My professional background is primarily centered on the field of Database Administration, where I have developed expertise in various areas such as SQL and bash scripting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've recently begun my journey into web application development, beginning with the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. I've had the opportunity to build static webpages and gain a foundational understanding of the essential technologies that drive the web. Although I'm still on the learning curve in web development, I'm eager to expand my expertise and capabilities as this semester progresses.

                    In the course ITMD 541 - Web Application Foundation, I'll enhance my existing knowledge by building a strong web development foundation. This includes web protocols, architectures, scripting, and mastering JavaScript for interactive user interfaces. I'll also explore key web development libraries and tools to further advance my skills.
