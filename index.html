            <p>
                Hi, my name is Harshal Sawant and I'm a masters student, studying Information Technology and Management program at Illinois Tech Chicago. I have 2 years of work experience working in the software industry back in India.
            </p>
            <p>
                The majority of my previous experience was dealing with databases and using Python, SQL, and Tableau. However, one of my previous experiences was as a mobile application developer, where I developed mobile apps with Flutter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My recent internship is a key reason I chose this course. I worked on the frontend of an application that our company developed. With the help of my mentors, I completed the task, but I realized I needed to learn more about basic frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I want to be prepared for future situations where I might need to use these web technologies at work, which is why I decided to take this course.

            <h2>About the Course</h2>
            <p>
                The ITMD 541 course focuses on building a foundation in web application development. I have worked as a mobile application developer in my previous experience so this course will help me strengthen my core knowledge about web applications and some extensively used tools such as Javascript. Here in this repository, you will find assignments and projects related to this course. This repository showcases my learning and progress throughout the semester.
